Blob Analysis (Chapter 2) of the Computer Vision Training for AUVSI Foundation teams

Learn to detect objects using blob analysis. Blob analysis will be used as a workflow to introduce the following topics: 
* Conversion between color spaces 
* Color thresholding 
* Morphological operations 
* Insert text and shapes in video frames 

These are fundamental operations that are useful in almost all computer vision applications.
